  <p>The possible cause of your plant's problem is **black spot**, a fungal disease that affects roses and other plants. It is more common in humid and rainy conditions. The fungus produces black or brown spots on the leaves and petals, which can eventually cause them to fall off. The disease can also weaken the plant and make it more susceptible to other pests and diseases.</p>

  <p>The possible solution for your plant's problem is to **remove the infected parts** and **spray with a fungicide**. You can use a pair of scissors or pruners to cut off the affected leaves and petals and dispose of them in a sealed bag or bin. Do not compost them as the fungus can spread to other plants. You can also use a fungicide spray that is suitable for roses and follow the instructions on the label. Spray the entire plant, including the stems and the underside of the leaves. Repeat the treatment every week or as needed until the disease is gone.</p>

  <p>Some other tips to prevent and control black spot are:</p>

  - **Water your plant in the morning** so that the leaves have time to dry before nightfall.
  - **Avoid overhead watering** that can splash water and spores onto the leaves.
  - **Provide good air circulation** around your plant by pruning regularly and spacing it away from other plants.
  - **Clean your tools** after using them on infected plants to avoid spreading the fungus.
  - **Choose resistant varieties** of roses that are less prone to black spot.
